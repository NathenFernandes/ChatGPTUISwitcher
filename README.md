# ChatGPT UI Switcher

A Chrome extension that keeps ChatGPT's beautiful gradient landing page background visible throughout your conversations, preventing the jarring switch back to black/dark backgrounds after sending messages.

## üéØ What It Does

By default, ChatGPT shows a beautiful gradient background on the landing page, but switches to a plain black background once you start chatting. This extension:

1. **Preserves the landing page gradient** throughout your entire conversation
2. **Makes UI elements transparent** so the gradient shows through
3. **Prevents background color flips** that occur during message sending
4. **Maintains proper text readability** with subtle dark overlays
5. **Provides an easy toggle** to enable/disable the effect
